# Traffic flow controller (TFC) 

TFC is a smartphone and web-based system that intends to provide intelligent simulation modeled solution for traffic congestion control to road authorities. Regular traffic control applications detect presence of traffic and update the wait time accordingly. These systems fail during roadside construction and at any privileged moment. TFC resolves the congestion problem using machine learning and providing a great visualization of data using simulation and modeling.

"*" It identifies damaged roads and potholes using machine learning on provided data gathered by cameras, GPR and daily congestions. 
"*" It also provides Traffic route control to privileged moment to maintain the real time flow of Traffic along with providing protocol to it. 
"*" It generates visual alerts to Admin during road maintenance and providing highest privileges to Admin to maintain normal flow of Traffic resolves the congestion issue due to unexpected events and other accidental factors. 
"*" It also works as an evacuation system during emergency condition providing the most reliable signal shifts. 
"*" 3d modeling can be used to train intelligent devices for real world scenarios.
